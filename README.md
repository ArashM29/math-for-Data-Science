## About the Project
In this project, I am presenting a comprehensive review of the fundamental concepts in statistics and probability essential for learning data science and machine learning. My primary objective is to offer readers a clear understanding of the underlying mathematical definitions through practical implementation using Python, such that readers can easily switch between their mental ideas, mathematical formalism, and the corresponding Python code.

# I will add the material to the repository gradually over time
